    <p>This is an example of a multiline blockquote.</p>
    <p>It consists of three lines of blockquote text.</p>
    <p>This is the last line of the blockquote text.</p>

    <p>This is an example of a multiline nested blockquote.</p>
    <p>The first two lines are the first (top) level elements.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>This is the second level of the nested blockquote.</p>
        <p>Followed by this second line of nested blockquote on the second level.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>This is the third level of nested blockquote as a single line.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We are now adding a second independent second level blockquote.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Additionally, nesting a third level blockquote.</p>
        </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Last but not least we are back to the first level blockquote now.</p>
